## CIFAR10 Image Classification using Tensorflow

### Overview
The project aims to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset, which consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, that include airplanes, automobiles, birds, cats, deer, dogs, frogs, horses, ships, and trucks. The project implements two different approaches that include a custom-designed CNN architecture built from scratch to serve as a performance benchmark and transfer-learning model that uses the VGG16 model pretrained on the ImageNet dataset. It fine-tunes it for the CIFAR-10 dataset to leverage the rich feature representations learned from a larger and more diverse dataset.


Key Features:
Data Loading and Preprocessing: Consists of scripts to load the CIFAR-10 dataset, normalize the images, and split the data into training, validation, and test sets.

Model Development: The project includes scripts and Jupyter notebooks to build, train, and evaluate both the baseline CNN model and the transfer learning model.

Model Comparison: A dedicated script to evaluate and compare the performance of the two models using common metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Web Application Deployment: The trained model is deployed as a web application using Flask, allowing users to upload images and receive classification results in real time. 

Objectives
Build and Evaluate Baseline CNN Model: Develop a custom CNN model for CIFAR-10 image classification and establish performance benchmarks.

Implement Transfer Learning with VGG16: Fine-tune the VGG16 model for CIFAR-10 classification and compare its performance with the baseline model.

Deploy Model as a Web Application: Create a user-friendly web interface for real-time image classification and deploy it using Flask

### Setup Instructions

#### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or later
- Git

#### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/your_repository.git
   cd your_repository
### Usage
To train the model, run the train.py script. The trained model will be saved in the model.h5 file. To evaluate the models on the test set, run the model_evaluation.ipynb file . The accuracy of the model on the test set will be printed to the console.
